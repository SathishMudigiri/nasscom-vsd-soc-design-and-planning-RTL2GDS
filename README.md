## Introduction to ASIC Design

Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are custom-designed chips tailored for specific applications offering optimized performance and efficiency The design process involves several stages from conceptualization to the final layout ready for fabrication
<br>
We will be using RTL IP's, EDA tools, and PDK data to form an ASIC Design. All these components will be taken from open-source sites as it makes it easier to design the flow.

For the RTL IP's, we will be using librecores.org, opencores.org, github.com and many other open-source websites. For EDA tools, we will be using OpenLANE, and OpenRoad. OpenROAD will be used for static timing analysis.

For the PDKS, we will be using Skywater 130nm PDK. SkyWater 130nm PDK is an open source PDK developed by SkyWater and Google in collaboration. PDKs include Process Design Rules like DRC,LVS etc., Device models, Digital Standard Libraries, I/O Libraries and many other things.

The EDA tools can perform the following processes.

## RTL to GDSII Flow

The transformation from RTL to GDSII encompasses

- **RTL Design**: Defining the desired functionality using a hardware description language

- **Synthesis**:
Converting RTL code into a gate-level netlist  <br>
The synthesis converts the RTL to a circuit out of components from the standard cell library. There are multiple different standard cells. Standard cells of the 
same component can have different areas based on the use case.

- **Floorplanning/Powerplaning**: Determining the physical placement of components on the chip.
  <br>There are 2 types of Floorplanning namely Chip Foorplanning and Macro Floorplanning. Power planning works on the placement of power sources such as Vdd and ground.

- **Placement**:  Positioning standard cells within the floorplan
<br>Placement is used to place the cells on the floorplan rows, alogned with the sites. It is done in 2 steps.

  The first step is Global placement in which the flow places the standard cells in optimal position even when they overlap with each other.

  Then, Detailed placement takes place which alters the position of the global placement so they do not overlap.

- **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**: Designing the clock distribution network.

- **Routing**: Establishing interconnections between components.
<br>It is used to implement interconnect using available metal layers. Metal tracks form a routing grid which is huge as it covers the entire chip.

- **Sign-Off**: Verifying the design meets all specifications before fabrication
<br>The Sign Off contains the Physical Verifications like Design Rule Check(DRC) and Layout Vs. Schematic(LVS).

    It also does the timing verification using Static Timing Analysis.

## Open-Source Tools Utilized

The workshop leverages several open-source tools

- **Yosys**: For RTL synthesis
- **OpenLANE**: An end-to-end flow for ASIC design
- **Magic**: For layout visualization and editing
- **Ngspice**: For circuit simulation and characterization
- **OpenSTA**: For static timing analysis
- **TritonRoute**: For detailed routing

## SkyWater 130nm PDK

The SkyWater 130nm PDK is an open-source process design kit providing the necessary files and guidelines to design and fabricate integrated circuits at the 130nm technology node ([github.com](https://github.com/VLSIDesignByRahul/Digital-VLSI-SOC-DESIGN-AND-PLANNING?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
